# React Lab - Click Counter and Binary Calculator (10 points)

## Overview

### Goals / Topics Covered

You'll be using the following concepts:

* React
    * props
    * state
    * events

### Description

Create these two pages with React:

1. a page that has a box with a number containing the number of times the box was clicked
    * clicking on the box will increment the number in the box
2. a page that calculates a binary number based on 8 bits
    * each bit can be clicked on so that it is set to either 0 or 1
    * every time a bit is clicked, the bit shows the current value (0 or 1), and the current decimal value is updated
    * +5 points extra credit if you get this one _actually_ working
